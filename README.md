## Installation
### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

<br />

### Download Expo Go

Download the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. https://expo.dev/client

<br />

### Run the server

This will start a development server for you.

```
npm start
```

<br />

### Connect to your server

Open the Expo Go app on your device and scan the QR code in your terminal to open your project.

Your app will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to rebuild or restart the development server to see changes in the app.

## How to use

### Add a card

You can add a credit card by specifying the card details. The information needs to be in the correct pattern.
